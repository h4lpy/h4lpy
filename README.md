## `💡` Projects

`🚩` [**Capture The Flag Writeups**](https://github.com/h4lpy)

All of my writeups for the abundance of CTF competitions I have entered. I try to keep this as up-to-date as possible, but sometimes there is a lot to go through :/

`🧠` [**Cerebrum**](https://github.com/h4lpy)

Inspired by [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/), this is my attempt at cataloging everything I learn for quick and easy CTRL-F-ing. You may be consider "information hoarding"... and you'd be right, but it has come in very useful so far.

## `📝` Blog

Currently I document cool or harder CTF challenges I have come across, but I would like to write more about forensics, malware analysis, and even malware development. Find my blog [here](https://0xh4lpy.medium.com/).
